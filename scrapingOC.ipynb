       "  'FVS-AMIE DES ENFANTS, formerly known as FVS-AMADE BURUNDI, is a non-profit association founded in 1992 by volunteers to help AIDS patients and their children. Following the armed conflicts in Burundi and the Great Lakes Region, FVS has committed itself to respond to the needs of many orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC): in 2021, ISTEEBU (Burundi\\'s official statistics service) estimates that 73.9% of Burundians are living in poverty; and 8.4% of minors are orphans, particularly children aged 10-14 and 15-17 (12.6% and 17.4% respectively).FVS has resolved to work for the protection of the rights of OVC, their access to basic social services and the economic self-promotion of vulnerable households for the well-being of children. To achieve this, it has innovated by initiating a community-based approach to OVC care based on the value of solidarity according to the Burundian wisdom \"Umwana si uw\\'umwe\" (\"a child does not belong to one person but to the whole community\"). The approach consists in creating Child Protection Committees (CPC) in every community and Village Savings and Loan Associations (VLSA) or Solidarity Groups (SG) that work for the economic self-promotion of households and the care of OVC in their communities.Thus, the members of VSLA/SG contribute every week in 3 funds: the \"actions fund” to grant credits for income generating activities, the “mutual aid fund” to support the members of the SG and the “OVC fund” to buy and distribute school kits to vulnerable children. Indeed, among the many needs of OVC, FVS considers education to be the best service provided to an OVC child because it allows him/her to become an autonomous adult and responsible for his/her life and thus transform his/her life in a sustainable way.We have also created several institutions in order to strengthen our action. In order to sustain the access of OVC to quality education, the secondary school “Amie des Enfants” was created. To support the economic growth of the members of the VSLA, a microfinance institution, \"Dukuze Microfinance\", was created. The mutual health insurance \"TUZOKIRA TWESE\", the center for the promotion of solidarity entrepreneurship \"CPES\" which promotes solar lamps and the center \"Agateka k\\'abana\" for children\\'s rights were also created.FVS is also recognized by the major development partners in Burundi. The \"OVC fund\", an innovation of FVS recognized by UNICEF as an essential asset for the sustainable improvement of education, has become a requirement for all UNICEF partner solidarity groups. And the government has recognized our Child Protection Committee approach as effective and sustainable: the Ministry of Social Action has integrated it into the national child protection policy since 2012 (FVS had been implementing it since 2002).',\n",

Thunder Valley envisions a liberated Lakota nation through a return to Lakota language, lifeways, and spirituality. Our communities have intense, intersectional and intergenerational trauma that we must heal and liberate from. Our innovation is in our holistic approach to healing and liberation. We have not only developed an interconnected approach to revitalizing our communities through programs that touch all aspects of life from home ownership to job development to food sovereignty, but these are underpinned by our Lifeways and Equity Work which enlivens and binds together these functional approaches with our traditional beliefs and cultural practices.

The scaling of Anansi can address the mental health of low-income youths who suffer from an inferior quality of life leading to poor academic performance and increased risk of harmful social, behavioral, economic, and health outcomes, including suicide. We have tested Anansi in four gold-standard RCTs that have shown large reductions in depression and anxiety. When analyzing pre-to-post effects, the weighted cost - effectiveness of Anansi exceeds GiveWell’s funding benchmark of 10x the effectiveness of a cash transfer. Having delivered Anansi to over 26,000 high school students in 2023, the team is well-positioned to continue efforts to scale to our ambition of reaching 1m youths in 2027.',\n",

ARMMAN’s integrated 360 degree approach leverages deep mobile penetration to work with pregnant women and under-5 children along with supporting health workers and systems for early identification, referral, and treatment of risk factors, resulting in improved health outcomes. We create at-scale programs with proven impact by using our unique “tech plus touch” model and building enduring partnerships (with national and state governments, partner NGOs and health facilities) that leverage existing health worker networks and health infrastructure. We are currently implementing the largest mobile-based maternal messaging program (Kilkari) and the largest mobile-based training program for health workers (Mobile Academy) in the world in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Programs implemented by ARMMAN have reached over 27 million women and their children, and trained 235,000 health workers in 19 states, with a planned pan-India expansion reaching 50 million women & 1 million health workers in 7 years, along with adoption of multimedia and “fit for purpose approach” where women and children will receive targeted interventions and greater handholding depending on their technology access, high risk condition, and multiple types of exclusion experienced on the basis of gender, class, race, caste and migrant status.',\n",

Skill Building: We provide comprehensive programming that focuses on skill development, equipping youth and families with the knowledge and expertise needed to thrive in today's economy. We offer training in various fields, including programming, entrepreneurship, and sustainable farming, enabling individuals to gain valuable skills that can lead to better employment opportunities and economic stability. 2. Youth Education: We recognize the crucial role education plays in breaking the cycle of poverty. We work to ensure that young people have access to quality education, offering scholarships, mentorship programs, and educational resources to support their academic journey. By investing in youth education, we aim to create equal opportunities for all, regardless of socio-economic background. 3. Entrepreneurship: We foster an entrepreneurial mindset among the youth and families we serve, encouraging them to start small businesses and become self-reliant. Through training, mentorship, and access to resources, we support aspiring entrepreneurs in developing their business ideas, honing their skills, and navigating the challenges of launching and sustaining a successful venture. 4. Sustainable Farming: Agriculture plays a crucial role in Uganda's economy, particularly in rural areas. We promote sustainable farming practices that enhance productivity, improve income generation, and ensure food security for vulnerable communities. By providing training in modern agricultural techniques, promoting sustainable land use, and facilitating access to markets, we empower individuals to build sustainable livelihoods through farming. Food Security: We address the issue of food security by implementing initiatives that aim to improve access to nutritious food for disadvantaged communities. We collaborate with local farmers, community organizations, and government agencies to develop sustainable solutions that increase agricultural productivity. Through our multifaceted approach, we are actively working towards social and economic justice by equipping Ugandan youth and families with the necessary tools, knowledge, and opportunities to overcome poverty, achieve economic independence, and contribute to the development of their communities.\",\n",
       "  \"To help move our work forward, I would appreciate support in: 1. Partnership Opportunities: As a small nonprofit leader and organization, we're always eager to explore new opportunities for partnerships and collaborations. We seek connections with organizations, businesses, and individuals who share our vision of empowering Ugandan youth and families. 2. Funding Opportunities: Sustainable funding is crucial for the continuity and growth of our programs. We would greatly benefit from the Delegate community's assistance in identifying new funding opportunities that align with our mission. This could include introductions to potential donors, grant programs, or fundraising platforms that can provide financial support for our initiatives. 3. Fresh Perspectives and Renewed Passion: I believe in the power of fresh perspective and renewed passion to I'm looking to learn from the community in sharing insights, experiences, and creative solutions that can help us further develop and refine our programming. 4. Leadership Development: As a nonprofit leader, personal and professional growth is essential for me to effectively lead and inspire my team. I would greatly appreciate opportunities within the Delegate community to learn from experienced leaders, participate in leadership development programs, and receive mentorship and guidance. By further cultivating my leadership style and skills, I can better navigate the complexities of our work and drive positive change within our organization and the communities we serve. 5.

Currently less than 3% of construction jobs are held by women deepening the already existing inequality, with over half the population of women in Kenya currently living below the poverty line of less that 3$ a day. \\n\\nIn addition, there are 2M workers needed in the Kenyan construction sector alone and only a fraction of that workforce is available. So Buildher is positioning women in particular to fill this skills gap in construction, essentially creating a bridge between the huge demand for skilled labour and the even bigger supply of informal workers. Our unique differentiator is that we are building this bridge with a focus on women.\\n\\nBuildher connects disadvantaged women to high-value employment opportunities in construction and furniture manufacturing. \\n\\nOur 2030 goal is to increase the % of skilled, certified women in Kenya's construction sector from 3% to 10% while ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. This would bring Kenya ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa and on-par with the most gender equal construction sectors in the world.\\n\\nWe are Kenya’s first and only technical training facility for construction artisans that exclusively trains women and actively promotes gender inclusivity in the sector. Our model and training approach have been distinctly designed to address the primary barriers that have historically excluded women from securing jobs in construction.\\n\\nIn addition to training, we run advocacy programs to gain public and government recognition of women's participation and leadership in the sector so that even more women can secure jobs at all levels\",\n",

YSMF mainly focus on advancing girls education and providing a vocational training to most vulnerable young mothers. We came to understand that adolescent girls from most vulnerable families to thrive, compete with their chin up, and achieve their end goal, they not only needs a free education of not paying tuition fee or other contributions but also a full package of education materials to make them focus and be able to attend all sessions while in class. Due to national crisis on climate change, adolescent girls have been the most victim group who suffer and fail to reach their dreams due to lack of accessing water and basic needs, parents use the hardship situations at home to manipulate their girls. The drought has caused many families lacking food and fail to gets jobs in farming. Many girls have been married off to reduce the costs of education materials in homes. In a process of long distance to fetch water, girls has been raped, some of them has been forced to be in sexual relationship by their family members so that they can get money, education materials or food from men in exchange for sex. Girls has been forced to stay at home because it seems as waste of time to attend school without writing so that they can stay at home with their siblings while their parents/ caregivers go looking for food. YSMF learned all these and came up with the innovation to mitigate the effects of climate change which lead to school dropout, teenage pregnancy and forced marriage by providing holistic education materials to most vulnerable adolescent girls who are supposed to be in school. YSMF supported 2600 adolescent girls with holistic education materials in 2021 and 1646 most vulnerable young mothers with business and entrepreneurship and vocational training. The girls are trained on Life Skills, Sexual and reproductive health, personal development and leadership throughout the year also we provided sanitary pads to enable attend school even when they are in their menses.',\n",
